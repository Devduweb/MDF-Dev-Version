[OBJECT:REACTION]

sample reaction
[REACTION:LUA_HOOK_HIRE_GUARD_DWARVEN] => Needs lua hook hire
[NAME:Hire dwarven caravan guard] => name doesnt matter
[BUILDING:TANNER:NONE] => Needs to be changed.
[REAGENT:A:10000:COIN:NONE:INORGANIC:GOLD] => 10000 = 500x20. Problem with reaction time. 20 times hauling coin stacks.
[PRODUCT:100:0:BOULDER:NONE:INORGANIC:STEEL] => Product does not matter
[PRODUCT_DIMENSION:15] => Line-of-sight radius around the workshop to target bodyguards.
[SKILL:TANNER] => Tanner is used as "Diplomacy/Ambassador" in MasterworkDF

product field must exist, using quantity 0 because it 
	doesn'tneed to actually produce anything.
	
product dimension determines sight radius in a circle with shadow cast visibility.

product probability + effective skill level determines chance to convert 
	each valid in range target, limit 1.  If the first found target fails, 
	the second found target has the same chance etc.  If all fail, reagents
	are consumed as normal (respects PRESERVE_REAGENTS if present)
	
if no valid targets in range are found, forces PRESERVE_REAGENTS
