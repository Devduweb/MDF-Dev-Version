DF Init was written by Zack Foote [xnrad].

Extract archive into your DF folder and banish the thought of ever editing the init by hand again.

Load default values will load ini and d_ini values default to v0.31.16.
If it finds init.txt and/or d_init.txt in the root DF directory, however, it will use those instead.
