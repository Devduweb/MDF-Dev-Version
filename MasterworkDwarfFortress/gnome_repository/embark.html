      <td width="665"><p align="center">The mod includes several pre-set embark profiles. This allows  a quick start and should help figuring out the different game mechanics.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Little People of the Forest</p>
        <p align="center">A small band of gnome druids and their animal friends are sent forth to consult with the wildlife in a choice location, to protect them and to teach them to protect themselves against the careless ecological destruction of the Big People.  You have little in the way of practical crafting skills, but with three high-level druids and a fair number of pets, persuading the local wildlife to join your settlement shouldn't take long.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Wisdom of the Earth</p>
        <p align="center">Rumor has it that the earth in your chosen location is rich with, well, riches, and gnomes love gold and gems almost as much as they love animals.  Set out with a team of miners and archeologists to uncover the buried treasure hidden beneath your feet, along with jewelers and metalsmiths ready to turn it into valuable trade goods.  Make good use of the geological seismograph and the excavation site - both will help you zero in on the valuables.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Tinker's Toys</p>
        <p align="center">A typical scouting/trading expedition, with miners, craftsgnomes, and carpenters... and a pair of talented tinkers who are quite possibly crazy, but if anyone knows the value of crazy, it's the gnomes.  They've brought a boxful of assorted odds and ends with them.  Who knows what kind of strange and wonderous gadgets they will make when inspiration strikes?</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Technological Arms Race</p>
        <p align="center">An adventurous and danger-seeking scouting team has been sent deep into hostile territory.  Fortunately, small and peace-loving people as they are, the gnomes are no slouch when it comes to defense.  You have enough equipment with you to build the latest and greatest weapons known to gnomekind (and possibly the world), and a pair of sharpshooters with the skills to use them.  Prepare for trouble.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Clockwork Nirvana</p>
        <p align="center">Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is simple - to head out into the world and construct the greatest gnome artifice ever made.  An clockwork paradise of moving parts, minecarts, and automated factories such as the world has never seen - an eternal testament to gnomish ingenuity.  A team of architects, carpenters, masons, engravers, miners, and mechanics will aid you.  But that's not all - you have with you a stable fragment of warpstone, a key ingredient in constructing the ultimate in gnome experimental technology, the Cosmic Gear.  Build it, and you will soon have all the time in the world.  Maybe.</p>
