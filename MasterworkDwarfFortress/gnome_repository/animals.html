        <h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Taming Wild Animals</a>        </h1>
        <p>Gnomes are strongly connected to nature, especially animals.  By treating your pets well and not allowing them to die, you will gain the ability to tame wild animals on sight and influence your pets in a number of different ways.</p>
		<p>To tame animals, go to the Nature Shrine and run the 'recruit animals from the wild' command.  It is best to put your high-level druids here, as they will have a much better chance at taming creatures.  The longer you run this reaction, the greater the chance of finding a Druidic Token, which is used to proceed to the next step of animal training: the Advanced Animal Training Area.  If you already have an Advanced Animal Training Area, you can use it to attempt to summon all the animals on the map at once.  The success of this will be dependent on your druidic merit, but it will ignore the skill of the user.</p>
		<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Whenever an animal is tamed, make sure to assign it a trainer, and make sure you have a (regular) animal training area available for use.  If the animal reverts back to its wild state, it will generally not attack your gnomes, but it may continue to follow its original trainer around and attack your other pets, making trouble until you kill it (which will hurt your merit score) or figure out how to recapture it using a cage trap - harder than it sounds, since it will avoid all your traps.  All gnomes have the animal training labor active by default, so simply assigning 'any trainer' to the animal should be enough.</p>
		<p>The Nature Shrine will allow you to do several other things: talk to birds for information about likely future events, summon fish in case you exhaust the local population, and check your current status with nature.  All except the last one requires you to have at least positive nature merit.  You can also release animals into the wild, which will help you raise your druidic merit.  See the Tips page for more information on how to keep your druidic merit high.</p>
        <h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Advanced Animal Training</a>        </h1>
		<p>At an advanced animal training area, you can influence your pets in a number of different ways.  This will require you to have positive nature merit, but beyond this, the success of the activities are based on the trainer's skill.  With a high-level trainer, you can train animals for hunting and war, get them to follow any unit you want, nickname them, and even raise their combat skill level.</p>
		<p>There are a number of caveats though: Some animals are easier to train for certain activities than others.  Aggressive or predatory animals are easier to train for hunting or war, but they will be harder to untrain.  Animals that like to travel in groups are easier to train to follow another animal.  High-value pets will be hard for low-level trainers to influence to do anything.</p>
		<p>To train an animal to follow another animal, pasture the leader close to the center of the training area and the follower further away.  It is easier to train a low-value animal to follow a high-value one than the other way around, but it will be harder to break them away.</p>
		<p>Training animals in combat techniques is a bit complicated.  You will need to have the animal trained for hunting or war, and have a druid who also has experience in close-range, unarmed combat.  Since gnomes are not by nature great unarmed combatants, it may be worthwhile to set up a 'dojo' of gnomes who spar without weapons specifically for this purpose, and give the animal training area a workshop profile that permits them in exclusively, so they will teach animals when not on military duty.  They will then be able to train animals to fight up to the teacher's current level.  In other words, if you have a gnome who becomes a grand master biter, that gnome can teach animals to also be grand master biters.  Unlike most animal training, an animal can learn combat techniques regardless of whether or not they respect the trainer, but higher-level animal trainers will be able to teach much faster in general.</p>
