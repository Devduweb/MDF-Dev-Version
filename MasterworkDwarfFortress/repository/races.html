            Your great civilization. Industrious underground dwellers with a love for beer and steel. Dwarves are notoriously simple minded when it comes to burning socks, but otherwise geniuses. They can create the most magnificent underground fortresses, build extensive traps and dig deeper then any other race. Using advanced technology and magic, they are capable of construction golems, landmines and guard turrets. Their trade caravans  usually consist of several wagons and bodyguards and carry many useful things to your settlement. Dwarven nobility has an unusualy high mortality rate however.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Special: The Mighty Dwarven Legion. A smaller dwarven civ, all members are either good fighters or mages. You can call them to your aid for 10,000 gold coins in the Embassy. Might be worth it when you are besieged and cant break the invasion.</strong></p>

            Intelligent, curious and Diplomatic. Relying on heavily on technology and Prayer. The Imperium of Man is the greatest above ground civilization. They form great townships and patrol a vast network of traderoads. Akin to dwarves, they do send big caravans with wagons full of goods, guns and ammo, metals and armor. They do use the peculiar tactic of siege warfare in case of war, blocking use of the surface and restricting both migration and trade. Make sure to stay on their good side, to benefit from this ally. Diplomats even go so far as spying out your traps, if you ever get attacked by a human siege force, mind that all traps seen by former diplomats are useless.</p>

            Nature-loving and cannibalistic, elves will never accept wood and protect the forest. The do make good archers and quick melee fighters though. What they lack in technology, they make up with magic and trained warbeasts. These are among the most useful tradegoods they offer, exotic animals ready to be trained. If provoked, and this can be easily done by felling too many trees, elves send ambush parties to slaughter your woodcutters. Their diplomats give you warnings first, so war is avoidable. Elven tradecaravans do arrive without wagons and are easier targets for possible ambushes themselves, so take care of your visitors. </p>

            Sadistic underground creatures, ruled by one matriach. Be sure to keep on their good side. No one really knows what exactly the drow want or how big their kingdom is. They do live in underground caverns and tunnel networks, rarely seen on the surface. The only race they trade with are the dwarves, maybe seeing a minor connection between the races, since both live underground. Drow use the fallen bodies of their enemies to create vile magic and will trade more or less anything. Dont be surprised to see cursed gargoyle statues, weapons and armor of a strange, demonic material and similar things. Drow ethics are just plain different from the other higher races. Just watch the incoming caravans, pulled by giant spiders, trade with the hooded, shaded figures, and hope they make it safely back to their fortress. Drow bodyguards can usually fend ambushes off themselves, so dont be too worried about them.</p>

          Shy, small and very advanced, gnomes are rarely seen out in the open. Only very wealthy fortresses will ever be visited by them. Gnome caravans arrive in summer and do not have escorts, to avoid detection. They are usually acompanied by a diplomat and a traders guild representative, who will arrange for future goods. You can buy clockwork parts from them, and blueprints for 2 special high-tech buildings. The artificer creates special weapons and armor that give your dwarves heavy buffs, as well as flamethrowers and firecannons. The weather control decive... controls... the weather... who would have though? You can let it rain, snow, or clear the sky.</p>
          <p align="center">You can also order some normal tradegoods, mostly made of iron, brass or steel, as well as engineer supply crates and trapparts.</p>

  Bandits, pirates and overall scoundrels, the humans that have left the empire and its strict rules survive by raiding forts and towns. Being inventive and well organized, these bandits can cause real trouble, since they have access to a great number if different technologies, stolen from all kinds of places. Beg, borrow or steal is the ethic of this, dare I call it, civilization? Dont be surprised to see musketeers next to heavily armored halberdiers, next to leatherarmored bandits using knives. Anything is possible with this lot.</p>
<p align="center">As tradepartners for the more open orc-races they can bring quite a nice assortement of tradegoods, and kobolds can steal the plan for a casino from them.</p>

They are great artisans and due to their abundant supply of ash, spewn forth from the volcanoes of their homelands, they developed many new glasses. These are so hard and sharp that they make good weapons and armor. While dwarves are uneasy about using glass instead of metals, the taiga orcs have already adapted to this technology.</p>
<p align="center">Being elves, they still ambush and kill from afar using their great bows and enchanted arrows, ride exotic animals into battle and are agitated if people harm trees. </p>

How they circumvent their cave-adaption and why they attack from the surface instead of the caverns is unknown, like so many other things about this enigmatic race.</p>

            Goblins are the default enemy you will face. They are no great fighters and their equipment is rather bad. Do beware of their ambushes. They can be easily fought with traps, since most of them are too stupid to notice giant sawblades and spikes waiting for them. Armies usually consist of  cruel  lashers, rather good archers and Trolls, too stupid to use weapons, but strong enough to break down doors and raze entire building. Some even reported seeing some sort of shamans in their ranks, but these sightings are rare. Equipped with rusty iron weapons and armor, your dwarven steel should have no problems fending them off. Beware of thieves and kidnappers however.</p>

            Orcs are the bigger and meaner cousin of the goblins. They brandish stronger weapons, too heavy for your dwarves to use, and have their own crude javeline throwers. They outweight dwarves as well. Be sure to step up your defenses once you transition from goblins to orcs. They do have rusty steel  equipment. A special tactic of the orcs is besieging your fort. The orc army will start campfires and wait you out for a few months, hoping to catch a caravan of guard, and starve you of outside resources.</p>

            Warlocks are evil and corrupted beings. They possess great power and will use a wide variety of magic spells. They do rely so much on those that their normal weapons are very basic, and their armor all but non-existant. Abuse this with archers and turrets. Some warlocks might be able to instantly kill dwarves when they come in range, others might raise an army of undeads. Which is not a good idea, since the undeads will fight the other warlocks as well, but these guys are crazy and just dont care. Once dead, you can pick up the icons and amulets they drop. Used to pray to their dark gods, you will do well offering them to Armok, as a sign of his vanquished foes. (this feature is not included yet)</p>

          Relentless metal Automatons. Mostly made of brass and devoid of emotion, these mute opponents attack everything alive. They do possess great mechanical knowledge and carry advanced ranged weapons. Created by the genius dwarven smith and scholar Kagrenac, the first artifical sentient life attacked its maker and started to make more of its kind. Running on steam and oil, their clanky movements betraying their strength, they pose a serious thread to anything alive. No one is sure what they want or how to appease them, and normally they are fought to the death, or all gates will be closed. Their corpses are a great pool of knowledge for you scientists and you should consider collecting them, to extract clockwork parts. </p>

            The ancient enemy of the dwarves. Frost Giants will bring the end of the world and invade your lands if they percieve your race as too advanced. You will need excellent gear on your well trained fighters to stand a chance. The massive frost giants rule in the glacial tundras, safe from any serious outposts by other races. Whenever they percieve a race to become too advanced, they will bear down on them and obliterate those who oppose them. Tall as houses, with weapons bigger then the average dwarf, you have to use all your brain and all your power to stand a chance. The supernaturally cold ice that they are made of can be manifactured into extremely sharp weapons or impenetrable armor. Getting it is of course not that easy... but rumors have it that dwarven scholars are working on a secret weapons against the frost giants, a new material, made of solid fire...</p>

            Antmen are underground sheperds.  Most of the time you will not even catch a glimpse of the antmen, but only hear their herds walking through the caverns underneath you.Most of the time they have a hard enough time against local wildlife in the caves. Their society is based upon a strict caste system, a warrior caste member will be much tougher then a sheperd. The strongest among them are queensguard and the queen, but these are rarely seen. Mind that they have four arms, usually carrying one weapons and three shields, making them very resilient against archers.</p>

They most important part you have to keep in my is that they can fly. If you tunneled into the cavern ceiling, they might stream through these holes into your fort. Reports of this happened have been rare however.</p>

          Simply and brutal creatures. Barely evolved, these cavemen will attack anyone that ventures into their territory. Wielding hammers and wearing a few parts of armor here and there, they should not stand a chance against well trained dwarven squads. They can appear in large numbers however, so see how big the horde is before you engage them in combat.</p>

Individual gremlins might also be spotted. They are on a rite to adulthood, which strangely enough includes sabotaging levers and picking doors.</p>

            Tiny Kobolds that live in caves. Tiny Kobolds that love shiny things, and will try to get to your loot. Living in small communities, mostly in caves to protect them from the bigger folk, kobolds are among the most curious races. People should almost feel sad for the obsessed little creatures, being torn to shreds by guard dogs. They do drop a bag full of their stolen items, so it might be worth chasing them down. If these secret raids on fortresses are really a kobold test of manhood as some believe, their race is surely doomed.</p>

Necromancers live a life of undeath and gather zombie minions around them. Building massive towers in evil areas of the world, they might amass their army at your fortress, to kill and harvest the corpses. Their armies consist of animated members of any civilized race, which will retain their abilities.</p>

              <p align="center">The Fortress Defense Mod and the info below have been written by darkflagrance.</p>
              <hr align="center" />
              <p><em>Tier 1: These enemies start besieging you when you have 20 dwarves, depending on how long it takes to reach your fort from where they are. Luckily, the most they should be able to do is disrupt trade, if you have any form of armor available.</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Dark Stranglers (size 40,000)</strong></p>
              <p>About 2/3 the size of dwarves and lacking in any form of armor, they are not much of a threat to an early militia. They do, however, have 4 arms and a very vicious bite, and are quite fast. As the weakest of the new enemies, they also attack the soonest.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Beak Wolves (size 50,000+)</strong></p>
              <p>These relatives of the familiar mount of Goblins, the Beak Dog, similarly attack dwarves with their crushing beak and sharp claws. However, they fight with greater cunning and skill than their wilder, less organized cousins, fleeing if the odds seem stacked against them. These black and white monsters will usually, but not always, attack a little while after the Stranglers.</p>
              <hr align="center" />
<p><em>Tier 2: These enemies come when you have about 50 dwarves. You'll only need a few good men to withstand these sieges.</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Frogmen (size: 50,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Frogmen are just a little smaller than dwarves. They treat water as no obstacle, and in addition, they only know how to use copper and cannot make many kinds of armor. They will probably flee when it is clear they are no match for you, but watch out for their arrows!</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>White Tigermen (size: 90,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Learning of the servitude their striped brethren have been forced into by the elves and dwarves, these northern avengers have come to wreak vengeance and liberate the enslaved! Though they are bigger than dwarves, their lack of strong armor and inability to smelt anything except copper means that dwarves should nonetheless easily defeat them.</p>
              <hr align="center" />
<p><em>Tier 3: These enemies come when you have about 80 dwarves. The real battles begin here. In addition to the civs below, vanilla goblins will also begin attacking you.</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Nagas/Helmetsnake Men (size: 50,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Half-serpent and half-man, with poisonous fangs. Their venom varies from merely paralyzing to capable of inflicting necrosis. The striking reflexes of their reptilian halves give them a great deal of speed when fighting.They use bronze and iron weapons, and include archers among their ranks. Nagas have developed some armor making ability; however, they cannot armor their snake-like lower bodies as well as dwarves. Also, they are dextrous enough to avoid traps.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Putrid Blendecs (size: 60,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Finally, an enemy the same size as a dwarf! Foul blendecs, which have cloven feet and eyeless skulls for heads, could only be found in evil areas in vanilla. In Fortress Defense, they attack armed with bronze and iron weapons and armor. Because they are a twisted mix of the undead and the living, they know neither pain nor fear, and your traps cannot target them. Lately, some Putrid Blendecs have been discovered to contain lumps of Cassiterite inside their bodies.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Ferric Elves (size: 60,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Ferric Elves are the remnants of elven communities who survived the fiery destruction of their forests. Left with no other choice, they learned to smelt iron and silver with the leftover charcoal and forged themselves into a formidable fighting force. Each member of their desperate race is trained to use a ranged weapon from birth, resulting in innate archery skill. Swift and agile, they are too graceful to be caught by traps. Cut off from their connection to nature they no longer wish to live, and experience no fear charging into battle, hoping only to end their internal pain. Please be so good as to oblige them!</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Hellfire Imps (size: 60,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Fire Imps are normally exceedingly small. Hellfire Imps, however, are their comparatively huge relatives who have grown so fond of setting bonfires that they have formed a marauding horde for the purpose of burning to death as many dwarves and other unlucky victims as possible. They use up to steel armor and weaponry (including fearsome whips), but their most fearsome ability is to throw or breath fire at their prey from range, a capability which is possessed by all of their troops. Shields are heavily advisable against them.<br />
                Note: you can cheese your way out of some of this by turning off temperature. (weaklings…)</p>
              <hr align="center" />
<p><em>Tier 4: The previous tier contained enemies that were about equal to dwarves. Now, the enemies outmatch them significantly. </em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Warwolves (size: 120,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Twice the size of dwarves, the lightning-fast, iron- and steel-wielding werewolves are guaranteed to defeat any similarly armed unskilled dwarf in single-combat. In addition, they avoid traps, meaning that there is no easy way to deal with them. If you wish to meet them head-on, no less than steel-armed dwarves will suffice.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>War Elephants (size: 5,000,000)</strong></p>
              <p>No, that size is not a typo. Elephants are massive, and they have come to lay waste to your fort just as they did the fortresses of old, only this time they come in heavy steel armor, wielding massive mauls or morningstars. Luckily for the player, Elephants do not wield shields with their trunks, and mainly rely on their tusks, their powerful bulk, and pure animal rage to kill your dwarves.</p>
              <hr align="center" />
<p><em>Challenge Version enemies: If it can be imagined, the power and ferocity of the following four races exceeds those of the previous tier by a ridiculous amount. They will pull no punches in their attempt to end your fort. That is why they have been sequestered into a whole league of their own.</em></p>
              <p align="center"><br />
                <strong>Nightwings (size: 120,000)</strong></p>
              <p>These jackal-headed fiends combine the much of the worst of the basic mode foes. They wield cruel weapons of steel, experience neither pain nor fear, disable your traps, are free of any need for breath or nourishment, and worst of all, they can fly on their leathery wings. They represent the most elite conventional fighting force you will face. Good luck to those who face them in battle!</p>
              <p align="center"><br />
                <strong>Minotaurossi (size: 220,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Minotaurs are the weakest of the semi-megabeasts in vanilla, imagined as solo attackers of fortresses! Their Fortrees Defense Mod cousins have banded together to steal the secret of steel from the dwarves. In battle, they know no restraint: their preferred weapons are whips, scourges, hammers, and halberds.</p>
              <p align="center"><br />
                <strong>Jotunar (size: varies, maximum 9,000,000)</strong></p>
              <p>If you reach this point (which may be sooner than you think), it means that a race of giants once exiled to the barren wastelands of the world has come to initiate Ragnarok upon your fortress! They come in various shapes and sizes, and some even wield fire. Due to their sheer size (more than 100 times the size of a dwarf!),  It will take legendary warriors, strong defenses, and masterful weaponry (blunt weapons can easily penetrate their armor!) to match these foes. But fear not! The enemies generated by Dwarf Fortress can possess neither great weapon skill nor arms. Weathering their storm is not impossible.</p>
              <p align="center"><br />
                <strong>Great Fiend Spiders (size: 100,000)</strong></p>
              <p>What happens when you take the bane of the depths of the underground chasms - the Giant Cave Spider - and allow it to breed in such numbers that it spreads across the land? The answer is the eight-legged plague known as the Great Fiend Spider. Though its size is not especially intimidating, its ability to fire silk and its deadly paralytic venom can cripple your dwarves, preventing them from moving or fighting back as they are torn to shreds by the dribbling mandibles of the spiders. Of all the foes in this mod, I fear these the most.</p>
              <hr align="center" />
<p><em>Bonus Enemies: The bonus tier enemies attack at the same time as Tier 4 enemies. They are very similar to dwarves in size and wield steel equipment. One could compare them to a well-trained dwarven militia.</em></p>
              <p align="center"><br />
                <strong>Greater Badgermen (size: 50,000+)</strong></p>
              <p>The Greater Badgermen are an ancient and proud race who, like dwarves, build great subterranean communities in the mountains. In battle, they work themselves into berserk rages while charging wildly without regard for their own safety. Throughout their lives, they gradually increase in size; a Greater Badgerman of venerable age will be 1.5x as big as a dwarf.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Pandashi (size: 50,000+)</strong></p>
              <p>The Pandashi are a reclusive race, but fond of contests to the death with powerful foes. If you survive long enough, the Pandashi will leave their bamboo forests to challenge you in battle. Their power comes not only from the foreign equipment they wield, but also their innate martial skill and their ability to enter martial trances. Their high awareness and agility allows them to dodge traps. Like Greater Badgermen, they gradually increase in size throughout their lives.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Raptor Men (size: 50,000+)</strong></p>
              <p>Raptor Men are essentially lock-picking upgrades of Frogmen. Feathered and scaled, they are capable of using steel weapons but have limited armor options. They can easily cross water to attack your dwarves, and simple locked doors cannot stymie their cunning minds.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Furies (size: 60,000)</strong></p>
              <p>Furies, like their cousins Harpies, possess the ability to fly. This resulted in their being removed from the Basic version due to flight pathfinding being broken. Unlike Harpies, however, Furies come in both male and female forms, and can wield weapons. Because they fly, however, Furies are not as well armored as other races. They use bronze only, and they are same size as dwarves.            </p>
