      <p><strong>General Info</strong></p>
      <p>The mod adds a few things on a very fundamental level, which are explained here. In short, there are 5 changes: Several labors have been renamed, Materials are standardized, AI knows Battlecries, Toys have been replaced with Illumination and the Arena is new. These are changes that carry across different play modes and races.</p>
      <p><strong>Labor Names</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/changes_labor names.png" width="527" height="647" alt="changes" /></p>
      <p><strong>Standardized materials</strong></p>
      <p>DF has creature specific bodyparts, tree specific woods and dozens of grasses, hundrets of gems. The issue with these is, that besides the name, nothing else changes. They clog up menus, confuse newer players due to their large variety, and slow down the game. MDF allows to remove most of these, which is one of the default settings. You can add most of this content back with the GUI if you want. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All leathers are called leather, not dog, cat, horse leather. Same for milk, cheese, meat, organs, skin, hair, blood and all other body materials. </li>
        <li>Many unused inorganics, minerals, rocks and gems and soils have been removed. Every single type that is in the mod has a specific use now. </li>
        <li>Many trees and plants have been removed, grasses standardized to normal, savage, good and evil grass, and wood is called wood, not oak wood, alder wood, birch wood...      </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Battlecries</strong></p>
      <p>All sentient creatures in this mod will identify other sentient creatures they fight against. A dwarf fighting a goblin will know that he is fighting a goblin and yell, threaten or insult him. The text will appear in the combat log, as shown in the example below. These battlecries are only ornamental and have no effect. All texts can be found in the data/speech folder and are very easy to alter yourself. I am always looking for more threats and insults, so if you want to contribute, please do. It is as easy as adding a line to the battlcry_.txt files in data/speech. This change is optional, and can be toggled in the GUI.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong>Illumination vs Toys</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Toys in DF never had any use, so I renamed the category to Illumination. Candles, Candelabras, Fireplaces, Braziers and Torches fall under that category, everything that has to do with light or fire. Both are a feature of this, because Braziers can be used to start semi-controlled bush fires, while Candelabras give actual light, if used with Rendermax, a dfhack plugin for dynamic lightning.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong>Arena</strong></p>
      <p align="left">The new arena consists out of many small cells that should ease the testing of several groups of enemies. It can be toggled in the GUI and is on by default.</p>
