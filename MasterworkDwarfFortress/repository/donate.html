      <p align="left">Thousands of hours have gone into the making of this mod over the course of over 3 years, and its possible to donate, if you wish. Keep in mind that both Dwarf Fortress and the mod are completely free.While Tarn Adams/Toady One is financing himself with donations alone, I'm a freelance blogger, photographer and athlete, financing my life with sponsoring and donations as well. If, and  to whom, you donate is up to you. You can find the contact info for both me and Mr. Adams below. </p>

    <p align="left">Thank you, one way or another, for helping DF.</p>
    <p align="left">On two occasions I have made a fundraiser, a set amount of donations in a certain time. Think of it as a tiny kickstarter. It allowed me to work twice for a full month on nothing but modding. Feedback has been very positive and I might do more crowdfunding in the future.</p>
