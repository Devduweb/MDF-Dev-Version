    The succubi unfortunatly did not develop metallurgy as well as other races and are outclassed by dwarves. It is a good idea to sort the spoils from sieges and melt down steel and mithril items you will find, with perhaps the exception of breastplates that you can wear on top of corsets.
Stygian Bronze is made at the smelter using bronze and flux stone. I addition of yielding even more metal per reaction (2 bars for 1 bronze), stygian bronze in unnaturaly lightweight. This metal is good for armor, providing protection without hurting speed and okay for cutting weapons. It is bad for blunt attacks and non bladed whips.

Basiliskine is, like stygian bronze, a lightweight metal suited for cutting weapons and armors. It's resistance is at the same level as steel, making it your best choice of protection without sacrifying mobility. It is obtained by shearing lesser basilisk (or their larger cousins) to obtain an horn that can be treated at the smelter.

Warpstone, usually fatal to those who mine it, is benefitial to Succubi. Your miners get positive effects from mining both weak and unstable warpstone.
