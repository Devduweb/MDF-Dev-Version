<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time,
averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may
attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their
numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate
area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will
rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they
are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They
will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping
creatures.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like
vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the
rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the
creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run
away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once,
so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly
outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going
berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were
not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance
of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate
miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture,
because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky
strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they
will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is
now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their
own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the
ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture
them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the
dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also
prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups
can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of
guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest
method: just eat them!</p>

<h1 align="left">Succubi - Pets</h1>
<h2><strong>Summoning creatures</strong></h2>
The creatures described here can be acquired at the summoning circle in
exchange of various items, mainly souls (obtained either by butchering
or by running the gathering soul reaction as the Soul Well). Some of
those creature are not tame whan summoned. This means that they will
act friendly, but cannot be trained or assigned to an owner until tamed.<br />
<br />
In order to tame a creature, you must build an empty cage. Then you
must design an activity area over it (i) and activate the
'animal&nbsp; training' activity. Put the creature inside the cage
then assign it a trainer on the animals screen (z then enter). Once
tame, you can free the creature by linking the cage to a lever and pull
it.<br />
<br />
Be warned that the creature may turn hostile if it forget its training.
Hopefully the succubi learn the training job at a fast rate to
compensate this extra job. In any case, not training a creature still
allow to complete any role that is not associated to one particular
inhabitant of your fort.<br />
<br />
The succubi and the pets are immune to each other's syndromes, so
friendly fire will not be an issue.<br />
<br />
One thing to note that there is an unfixable bug concerning caravan,
all slaver merchants (Orcs, Drows, Goblin, Succubi) will 'kidnap' the
pets they bring. You will be spammed by kidnapping messages but no
creature of your fort will be lost. However, this means that sold
creatures will not count towards your exports. If you wish to raise
wealth, you will be better off butchering valuable beasts to make
crafts.
<h2><strong>The pets</strong></h2>
These common creatures can be bought from caravans or the embark screen.<br />
<h3>Nahash - Hunts vermin, adopts owner, lay eggs (female)</h3>
These snakes are cheap vermin hunters who will prevent related bad
thoughts. They can not defend well in a fight and is the genral
equivalent to cats in a dwarven fort, with the exception that females
also produce eggs.<br />
<h3>Rat thing - Hunts vermin</h3>
These human faced rats will also hunt vermin in your fort. They also
have the ability to teleport towards visible enemies for a suprise
attack. Combined to the fact that they are cheap to summon, you can
unleash a horde of biting rats from safety.<br />
<h3>Orthus - Trainable (hunt, war)</h3>
The orthi are two headed dogs. They are summoned tame and can be
trained as bodyguard immediatly.<br />
<h3>Cauchemar - Trainable (war), milkable (female)</h3>
Demonic horses who never tire, the cauchemars are the lesser cousins of
nightmares. They are the steed, pack animal and wagon pullers of the
succubus civilization. Be warned that herds of wild cauchemar often
roam
the caverns. They almost always attack by kicking, dealing lethal
damage with their hooves.<br />
<h3>Devilkin</h3>
A cheap creature to attack the enemy en masse. It will flee if injured
but its numbers can confuse invaders.
<h3>Tentacle monster - Milkable, lay syndrome, tainable
(war)</h3>
Unlike what their reputation says about them, tentacle monsters are
ressource generator and trap layers. Their many tentacles allows them
to fight despite wounds making them formidable foes. They also secrete
slime that stun enemies either during attacks or by laying it in their
path. This slime can be collected by milking the creature at a farmer's
workshop. It edible when cooked or can replace oil in reactions. In
addition, tentacle monsters will clean nearby succubi off contaminants,
making forgotten beast diseases less likely.<br />
<h3>Lesser basilisk - shearable, breath</h3>
The weaker cousins of the basilisks grows a metallic horn to hit
intruders with. If the horn is long enough, it can be sheared then
processed at a smelter to produce a bar of basiliskine, a light steel
grade metal. They also breath a poisonous vapor that slow down enemies.<br />
<h2>High tier summons</h2>
More powerful creatures to protect your fort with, but the required
ressource will limit their numbers.<br />
<h3>Shothoth spawn - ambusher, lay syndrome</h3>
Like the tentacle monsters, these large monsters attack with several
limbs and secret slime. This slime however causes severe necrosis to
unprotected foes. In addition, shothoth spawns turn themselves
invisible to its enemies who only notice its presence when the trampled
grass approaches.
<h3>Bebilith - webs</h3>
A large spider that attacks with a poisoned bite and webs. With the
right setup, it can be abused to collect silk.<br />
<h3>Frost wraith - breath</h3>
A large and cold gargoyle, who attacks with a frost breath.<br />
<h3>Obsidian colossus</h3>
A massive obsidian creature, useful when brute strength is required.<br />
<h3>Horrible Fell Spirit</h3>
Or HFS for short. Summoning those will be a gamble on your adamantine
stock as there is no telling what creature you will get. Unlike the
other creature described here, its syndromes will affect everything,
even your own succubi.<br />
<h2>Fire throwers</h2>
These creatures must be handled with care. Combined with succubi
upgraded at the Temple of Fire, they can burn entire sieges.
<h3>Fire imps</h3>
These creature are famous among Dwarf Fortress players. They throw
fireball at long distance and jets of flame at short range.<br />
<h3>Fire maiden</h3>
These distant cousins of the succubi will count as a citizen in your
fort, unfortunatly they are too intelligent to be trained as a beast.
They can be left around the meeting areas, given there is no items to
burn there or; with a few tricks, can be placed at strategic spots.
They are known to unleash devastating melee attacks at their foes.<br />
<h3>Nightmare</h3>
A large fire breathing horse. The combine lethal kick with painful
fiery death. Wild nightmare can fly, but considering the way DF handles
pets, summoned will stay at ground level.<br />
<h3>Hellhound</h3>
A fire breathing dog combining long range and close attacks with
powerful bites.<br />
<h3>Cerberus</h3>
A three headed fire breathing dog. Unlike the hellhound it cannot hurl
fireballs but it's extra head combined with firejets make it more
dangerous in close combat.<br />
<h3>Spirit of fire</h3>
A towering humanoid that immolate everything it touches. It is
recommended to use a fireborn succubus to summon it.<br />
<h2>Other pets</h2>
<p>Depending of the world generation, a succubus civ will
also tame underground creatures. You are likely to have drow spiders
and bats available.</p>
Scout may also complete journeys into the wilds too, and you may get a
wild creature or two as pets. </td>
