      <td width="665"><p>Masterwork DF tries to keep the DF feel alive. It is not a total conversion, and Fortress Life will go on as usual. It does have many extended Industries however, which you will get to know by playing Fortress Mode. If you want to alter the mod to better suit your wants, you can follow these easy steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Run Masterwork Settings.exe to add/remove parts of the mod.</li>
          <li>Choose the tileset you like. Masterwork, Phoebus, Ironhand, Ascii, Soviet, Taffer, CLA, Matrix or JollyBastion.</li>
          <li>Run Graphical Settings.bat if you use Phoebus to customize your tileset.</li>
          <li>Gen a new world using the adv. world gen with the included templates.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You now have your very own version of Masterwork DF.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">How to do a bug report</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry, had to add this. When finding a bug, please report it to me, otherwise I cant fix it. Please only use the MasterworkDF board on Bay12 for this. Also, and this is very important, please include your Operating System (Win/Linux/Mac), your mod version (Check the main menu ingame or your rar for it) and your tileset. The tileset is really important, because I use different sets of raws for each. A bug might only exist in one, and if I look at the default one I might not find it. </p>

<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started with a Fortress</strong></p>
        <p>When you embark in fort mode you have three new options on the embark selector, the map in which you chose your embark. You can run Nanofortress that allows 1tile-wide embarks, for 1x1 embarks that help FPS greatly, or 10x1 embarks if you like odd sizes. You can run EmbarkEverywhere, which allows you to embark on town, fortresses, tombs and towers. Expect heavy resistance in that case. And you can type 'startdwarf n' into dfhack, without the '' and with n being any number you like. startdwarf 25 would lead to 25 dwarves at embark. This way you can alter your starting group number.</p>
        <p>Then you need to make your embark profile. You can pick one from the list to roleplay a bit, or make your own. I do recommend taking more seeds and food then usual, because plants grow slower and birds give less eggs. Trading and Hunting and Butchering are your friends, since underground plants take an entire year to mature. In general I'd recommend to read the Domestic Pets page of the manual to make yourself aquainted with the new pets. They are far more versatile then the vanilla pets and grazers can even be fed underground in the Stables, a new workshop.</p>
        <p>You will notice many new skills, which are not important at embark. You will probably not need high-level chemists, alchemists, toolmakers or beast dissectors, poisoners or chandlers when you start. To see a full explanation of these skills, see both the General Changes - New labors/skills section and the Workshop/Furnace sections. The latter is a long read, but gives info about all building in the mod.</p>
        <p>My recommendation is to take a lumberjack, several miners, some vermin-hunting pets, some scarecrows and one mastiff, ironclad dog or drake for early defense. After embark, just business as usual, felling trees, digging rooms, building a moat... the moat is probably more important, as wildlife can be more dangerous in the mod. Taking one fighter at embark is not a bad idea.</p>
        <p>Once you start building workshops you will notice a large list of new buildings. The basic ones only cost blocks and are available from the start. You can build Workshops, Diplomatic Buildings, Administration and Trading, Farming, Studies, Relligious Buildings, Libraries, Basic Smelters, Illumination and Decorations. </p>
        <p><strong>Important: Check the Ore Processor, the Smelter and the Metallurgist, because metal production got more difficult in this mod. Note that the Trading Stalls require a &quot;Trade Licence&quot; which you must first order from a caravan.</strong></p>
        <p>If you want advanced buildings, you need a Researchers Study, which unlock new buildings. See their entries in the buildings section for full info. It will unlock Advanced Smelters, Advanced Forges, Upgrading, Magic, Golems, Machinery and Laboratories. Getting every single mod-building in a single fort will take years. So better focus on one industry that interests you the most. </p>
        <p><strong>Important: The Alchemist/Liquid Spawner and the Megabeast Kennels. You might find these interesting, as the first one allows to spawn Magma, the second one allows friendly pet-megabeasts.</strong></p>
        <p>If you play with the default settings, which is something I do recommend, you will notice that the game is both harder and easier at the same time. Fortress management and item production should be easier. You have so many new workshops and ways to combine them that life is easy on your dwarves. You can call migrants and caravans at will, raise the skill-learn-rates by having your dwarves join guilds, make way betters weapons and materials then in the original game. But at the same time you will face stronger enemies, cavern-sieges, possessed dwarves and cults that sneak into your fort, workaccidents, strange finds while mining and cursed items. Learning all this in one go can be a challange, so many balancing options are available in the Settings.exe. The default settings are based on maximum FPS-increase and maximum features, even if the features make the game arbitrarily harder. </p>
        <p>I dont want to ramble on too long, least you lose interest, but a few words about advanced game features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hospitals are the same as always.</li>
          <li>Military is the same, but better build a Garrison and do Military Training first.</li>
          <li>Good metals need Ore Processor, Smelter and Metallurgist.</li>
          <li>Better metals need the Crucible and Finishing Forge.</li>
          <li>Weapons/Armor are the same as always.</li>
          <li>Better Weapons/Armor require Weaponry/Armory/Greatforge/Gunsmith.</li>
          <li>You can further increase them with Rune Weaponry/Armory and Toxicologist.</li>
          <li>Migrants and Sieges are the same as always.</li>
          <li>You can willfully spawn migrants, caravans and sieges at the Embassy.</li>
          <li>Check the &quot;Misc&quot; section of traders and liaisons. Many more options there.</li>
          <li>Armored and trained warbeasts rock. Seriously. Legendary Steelclad Raptors.</li>
          <li>Read up on the Magic System. Its new, and feedback on it is very helpful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks for the interest in the mod, for reading this wall of text, and I hope you will have fun. </p>

        <p>It might be in the works, but currently MasterworkDF is rather oddly balanced when it comes to Adv. Mode. </p>
        <hr />
        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started with Legends</strong></p>
        <p>Honorary metion of Legends mode: Nothing has changed, except that Legends depict more events, since more of them happen in this mod. I do recommend opening Legends Mode only to extract the data and use the LegendsViewer, an included utility to read through it. Awesome stories can be found deep behind walls of text.</p>
