        <p align="center">This Mod alters DF in so many ways, that the normal world generation process is not reliable anymore. For the best results please use one of the many templates that this packet includes. Different Worlds have different themes and hopefully easy role playing.</p>
      <p align="center">All maps are 65x65 tiles, have 10 z-lvls minimum before the first cavern. Caverns are generally very open to help FPS and contain small lakes. Minerals, Flux and Gems are plenty on all maps. All evil region interactions are active, as well as a very high number of megabeasts and titans. You will also find many caves. I advise not to run these worldgens longer then 300 years to ensure that the high number of invaders does not diminish your allies.</p>
      <p align="center">The very first worldgen, called &quot;Starters World&quot; is the easiest setting any new player can hope for. Maxed out embark points, no nightcreatures or demons, no evil rains or interactions.</p>
