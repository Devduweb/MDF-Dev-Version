          <hr align="center" />
<p align="center">All these tricks are collected from the forum and are for vanilla DF. They also work in the mod, but there are no mod spe<em>cific entries here.</em>          </p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>1. Mass Dumping</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By pressing d-b-d you can select every item on the   screen for dumping. In the same menu you will find the shortcuts for Unumping   (d-b-D), Forbidding (d-b-f) and Reclaiming (d-b-c)  <br />
            <br />
            <strong>2. Quantum   Stockpiles</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>In stockpile, every item requires one square. By   making an open-space square and marking it as a garbage dump, you can throw   unlimited items into it. Everything will staple in a place one Z-level below.   Just dig an access tunnel and unforbid the items to use them. Note that no   actual stockpiles are necessary. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>3. Atom smashing</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Items under a closing drawbridge will be removed   from the game. An atom-smashing device would use a Quantum Stockpile and a   raised drawbrigde that closes upon the Quantum stockpile, destroying everything   inside. Used to remove clutter and help FPS. Can also be used as an exploit (?)   to kill creatures. Creatures of immense size will instead destroy the bridge,   when lowered. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>4. Watchtowers</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Ambusher will move invisible over the map, till   they encounter a living being. By placing pets on chains on chokepoints you can   detect them safely. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>5. Building destroyer traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>A creature with the building destroyer will path to   the nearest building. Building a little maze with a statue inside, protected by   cage/weapon-traps will neutralize the threat. Works most awesomely with a   Support holding a 3x3 floor one Z-level above. Support gets destroyed and the   3x3 square will fall down, killing everything with a cave-in. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><br />
            <strong>6. Trapping trap-avoid   creatures</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>It is possible to trap creatures that avoid traps   by placing a web over the trap. Getting a gaint-cave-spider to shoot at your   traps does somehow require some preperation. Easier when done with tamed   spiders. Cave-In dust will also push creatures into traps. The stun-effect will   disable the trapavoid. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>7. Saving dwarves that are outside during   invasion</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Build small rooms in the countryside, 3x3, with a   floorhatch and some food/drinks inside. When a force of darkness arrives, send   your dwarves into those by adding them to burrows you made in these bunkers.   Afterwards lock the floorhatch. Miner can rescue themselves, by digging a 1x1   channel, and then again a 1x1 channel in the same square. No direct pathing and   no direct line of sight will keep the invaders away. Afterwards dig exit   stairs. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>8. Wells can be built with many Z-levels   between them and water.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>A 50 Z-level drop to a cavern lake is absolutely   possible. But note that the bucket has a longer way to travel, making them less   effective. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>9. Water can be drained by engraving   fortifactions on the map edge.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>All water will now flow through and off the   map. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>10. Picks use the mining skill even in   combat.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Assign legendary miners into your army, or draft   them as a back up militia. Enables fast training for your soldiers as well, just   designate a huge area for digging, enable mining labor and give all your   soldiers picks. Legendary weapon skill in no time. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong> 11.Ballistas are very inaccurate.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By building a 3-tile wide corridor and a 5-tile   wide room in the end you can build 3 ballistas that cover one corridor. Build   the first ballista to the left, the second behind it one tile to the right, the   third behind it another tile to the right. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>12. Dwarves build walls from the wrong   side.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Default is to build from the left or top to build a   construction. To avoid getting your dwarves stuck just build a wall in the   square you want your dwarves to avoid, and suspend it before it is finished.   Then finish the construction you wanted, and cancel the suspended wall. Dwarves   will always choose to stand on a normal square then a square designated to be   used in any way.  <br />
          </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>13. Designation selection</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>When you designate, for example, every tree to be   cut the woodcutters will start top-left, no matter how far away this is. To   avoid long distances for your workers and haulers designate a smaller block   nearby, afterwards expand slowly. That is also safer, since your dwarves will no   longer be scattered all over the map. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>14. Cavern avoidance</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you want to avoid caverns and get straight to   the magma, dig your stairs in a straight line in one of the corners of the map.   That reduces the chance to hit a cavern significantly. </em>You can also <em>start building a farmplot, but before you press enter just take the farmplot and scroll down. The X that indicate if floor is soil or rock will turn green once they are above cavern soil. This is an exploit that has been named &quot;dwarven radar&quot; and can be found in the bay12forum, in case you want more info and screenshots.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>15. Designation over multiple   Z-levels<br />
          </strong>By using your mouse to do a designation, holding the mouse   button down and then scrolling Z-levels you will apply the designation in every   Z-level. Helps a lof for building long Up-down-staircases and pumpstacks. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>16. Free marksman equipment</strong> <br />
            If   the ambusher skill is the highest skill a dwarf has at embark, he will embark   with a leather armor, a crossbow and 25 random material bolts. Just disable the   hunter labor and you have a fully geared back-up marksdwarf from the very start. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong> 17. Make your woodcutter your animal   trainer.</strong> <br />
            Woodcutters are the most exposed and endangered dwarves   you have. Adding war-dogs will protect them, but the bads thougt of dead pets   might cause tantruming. But unassigned war-animals will always follor their   trainer. This way you can protect your woodcutters and keep your wardogs free   for other assignments if needed. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>18. The trade depot has an alternate   setting for finding tradegoods. </strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>You can sort by distance (default) or by value, or   even find by name. Just look at the hotkeys in the bottom of the tradescreen.   This saves a lot of time. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>19. Trade ways</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By pressing D you can see if a 3-tile path is   aviable from the map edge to your trade depot. Although wagons do not work in   the current version (31.25) it is still possible to control the caravan spawn   point. If you have only one path aviable from depot to edge, the caravan will   always spawn there. Makes it easy to protect them from ambushes/invaders, </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>20. Dodge traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Almost an exploit, you could build weapon traps on   a 1-tile wide floor, with open space on both sides. Imagine a long, narrow   bridge made of floor-tiles, covered in weapon traps. Creatures that step on the   traps will try to dodge and fall into the pit next to them. This is extremly   effective. Most useful when a natural pit is aviable, like a river. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>21. Wildlife traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Free roaming animals will almost never get into one   of your cagetraps. To increase the change build a gaint X on the map made of   walls. Leave the center tile free, so animals can path through it. Then build   cagetraps in the center. The larger the X, the higher the change for a catch.   Will also work for ambushers and invaders. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>                                       <strong> 22.   Metal Furniture</strong>                                          </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Metal furniture can be built by a mason out of the   metal. No need for a forge and coal. Uses the mason skill. You have to enable   the material first in the Stone screen. Press z and go to Stones at the top. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>23. Deadly Ice</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you have frozen rivers or lakes and want to   avoid drowning dwarves in spring, go to the traffic designations, d-o-r, and   mark all ice as restricted. Dwarves will now walk around it. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>24. Tree growth</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you want to prevent trees from growing in your   soil and clay corridors, create a stockpile with no goods enabled over them.   Plants will no longer grow there, but take care: As soon as you remove the   stockpile all trees that did grow invisible underneath it will pop up   instantly. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><br />
            <strong>25. Spoiler Material – Read with   care</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you ever happen to have a blue metallic thread   in your possesion, take care to limit access to it. Doctors will use it to   suture patients.If you ever happen to find a blue masterpiece weapon on your   map, construct a floor in front of it. The weapon can be deconstructed like a   building and claimed for your army. But beware, if you build the floor, you will   rob yourself of fun. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>Honorable mention: Danger   Room<br />
          </strong>A danger room is a small 3x3 – 5x5 room full of upright spike   traps, filled with wooden training spears. Linked to a lever that has: Pull the   lever (R) activated this causes everyone stationed in the room to learn combat   skills very fast. Be careful not to station mothers with babys or petowners in   the room. A locked door helps keeping people in longer. Quite a few people   regard this as an exploit, since your dwarfs become overpowered. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>PS: I buffed the dangerroom in the mod, so use it with care. It might be more dangerous then you remember.</em>        </p>
        <p align="center"><em>PROTIP: Read the Wiki at <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" >http://df.magmawiki.com/</a></em></p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="HUMAN" id="HUMAN">Mod-Specific Tips and Trick</a><em>s</em></h1>
        <hr />
        <p align="center"><em><strong>1. Custom Catapult Ammo</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Catapults and Ballistas are really bad in vanilla DF. But the mod includes the siege-engine-control plugin. You have to look at a siege engine using 'q' and then press Alt-A to start it. You can now load custom ammo into catapults. That can be anything, boulders, blocks, weapons, furniture, corpses... </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>The best ammo is: loaded cages. Throw cages full of wild animals. Throw landmines this way. Even throw golems. The thrown creatures take no damage, because the flying objects is the cage. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Magma Landmines</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While very ineffective at spawning large quantities of magma, the liquid spawner can be used another way. Once you use the &quot;blood of armok&quot; gem to create magma, just leave it be. The liquid will remain safely inside the workshop till it is deconstructed. So all you have to do is dot the landscape with spawn locations, spawn magma in them and wait for a silly creature with building-destroyer tag. It will raze the workshop and spawn magma right next to it.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>3. Web + Fire Combo</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Many weapons and creatures can throw webs. Many weapons and creatures can shoot fire. Normally, both are a good weapon, but creatures cant be harmed by webs alone and most invaders dont take much damage from fire. This is because they only bring metal armor, but dont wear flameable clothing. They also have shields to block the firejet.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>But if they are webbed, they cant block the fire. And webs themselves can burn, settings things around them on fire. To make it short: Station a web and a flame turret together, or use a dwarf with a net-thrower and a fire-breathing warpet. That combo is quite deadly.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>4. Correct landmine usage</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Landmines are quite easy to counter by the enemy, so here three simple ways to use them well:</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>A: Put them in a maze next to the corners. This way  ranged units cant kill</em> them from afar.</p>
        <p align="center">B: Put them in build cages that are linked to levers. Wait for invaders, release landmine.</p>
        <p align="center">C: Build a murder hole. Wait for invaders, lock them in a room, then one z-lvl above have a p<em>asture of landmines and a hatch. Then simply dump the landmines down the hatch, right on the heads of the invaders.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>5. Item/Material Combos</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>A big  part of the mod  </em>are the new workshops. These can sometimes be exploited<em> and do something they were not designed for. For example you can &quot;collect clay&quot; for boulders, &quot;make blocks&quot; from them, then compress the blocks in the crucible to slade. Free slade for everyone. Another example is slag. Slag bars, as useless as they are, can still be used for constructions, they make cheap metal walls and floors.</em> No need for a slagp<em>it this way.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><br />
          <strong>6. Absolute Overkill</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em>You can improve weapons in the weaponry. You can coat weapons with poison in the toxicologist. You can engrave weapons with runes in the rune weaponry.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>You can also do all three to one weapon. A masterwork legendary mithril great axe, coated with 10 different runes and 20 different poisons... will probably insta-kill everything it hits. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>7. Early poisons</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While on the topic of poisons: They can be bought directly at embark under the &quot;extracts&quot; section. So take one barrel of nasty poison, like cave spider venom or coral snake venom and your early military will have no problems. Give one dwarf 5 points in dodging and in a weapon skill, take one cheap weapon and one barrel of poison. Thats it, your first soldier will now almost insta-kill all normal creatures.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>8. Starting Number of Dwarves</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Just a friendly reminder: If you type &quot;startdwarf X&quot; into dfhack before you embark, your starting 7 will be your starting X. 200 dwarves at embark? No problem. Just keep in mind that they need food and drink. I myself embarked very successfully with 42 kobolds once, so higher numbers are possible if managed correctly.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>9. Smoke Effects give extra experience</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>If you want to cheat a little, tiny bit, you can enable to Smoke Effects. Labled purely ornamental, the button adds smoke, sawdust, sparks and similar effects to workshops. But since they are an extra item that is created, they also generate extra XP for the worker. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>10. Crates at Embark</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>To buy otherwise inaccessable custom tradegoods, check your &quot;misc&quot; section at embark. You might have to ramp up your embark points in the worldgen, but you will find all crates in there. Books at embark? Steel Armorsets? Rare Trade-only Plants?</em> No problem. You will still need the Storage Warehouse to unpack them.</p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong> 11. Protecting Miners, Hunters and Woodcutters</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Since these three professions have a conflict of uniforms, you cant assign them military armor, while they mine, hunt and fell trees. But you can make civilian clothing from metal strands, or from the high-tier animal materials like rigid chitin/scale/shell or lamellar leather. These are at least irongrade or higher and will keep your civilians safe.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>12. DFHACK</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Dfhack is not just for cheating, it is a powerful tool for the player. Read the readme. Memorize the hotkeys. Have a look at the custom plugins that are included. Open dfhack.init and read through it. Use it. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can designate entire veins for mining, load custom ammo into siege engines, you have a mini-therapist included in the game, the dwarf monitor that shows how efficient the dwarves work, the workflow plugin which is an improved manager, autobutcher for farming, searches for many sub-menus... renaming of workshops or even pets and more.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>So yeah, PROTIP: Learn to use dfhack efficiently.<br />
        </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>13. Battle-Picks, Great Axes and Javelin Throwers</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Miners, Woodcutters and Hunters dont have to use the normal picks, woodchoppers and crossbows. You can give them finest military-grade gear, which will make them a lot better suited for combat. Mind the battle-picks dont mine faster and great axes dont cut trees faster, but otherwise they are a huge improvement.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>14. Invaders Infighting</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Different races follow different ethics. This means that the Frost Giant siege, that is bothering you, can be cleaned</em> by getting even more enemies <em>on the map. Warlocks are especially good for this, since their spells are AoE. So maybe, just maybe, it is a good idea to spawn more invaders or megabeasts using the embassy, if you are locked in your fortress by superior invaders. It might not work, because you might end up with two invading armies that are best buddies, but you can always try.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>15. Even more Infighting<br />
        </strong>There are many options to make enemies fight themselves. Voodoo and Nether poisons are one, raising the dead with the bonerattle is another. To deliver the poison it is best to coat ammo, otherwise your dwarves will get caught in the fray. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can also reroute your entry through the caverns, forcing invaders to battle with cavern monsters. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>16. Sacrificing Possessed Dwarves</strong> <br />
        If you play with &quot;secret fun stuff&quot; on, you will now and then stumble upon a suspicious dwarf. While most of them  can be cured</em>, it is far easier to simpl<em>y tell them to go to the Altar or Temple of Armok and sacrifice themselves to the Blood God. This will not only net you a nice item as a reward, but also gets rid of the possible danger they pose. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can also use them for golemification, pacifiyng them in the process.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong> 17. Exploiting autosyndrome</strong> <br />
          Many reaction</em> use a specific dfhack script to work. Boiling <em>rocks most of all. Be it guilds or military groups, golem forge or animal armoring, you can often trick it into targetting multiple creatures. So if you want to safe some reagents, simply station 10 soldiers on the workshop, or pasture 20 dogs to be armored, or 30 changelings/sprites to become a new creature. You might be in luck and get several transformations from one go.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>18. Downright cheating with autosyndrome</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While I dont recommend this, several people stumbled upon it, so I might as well say it: All reactions using autosyndrome, which is usually everything that affects the worker, can be done for free. Start the reaction, wait for the 'A' for active next to it, and before the dwarf finishes the reaction, cancel it. While no product is created, the script still notices that a reaction has been finished (even if it is cancelled) and it will run the script. This means you can run the reaction without using up the reagents. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Since this is cheating, not just an exploit, I can only ask you not to abuse it all too much.</em> It kills the FUN.        </p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>19. Digv vs Metalwraiths and Coaldust</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">Coal<em>dust, Metalwraiths and hidden fun stuff in inorganics, are all specific inorganics that you cannot distinguish from the surrounding rock. But dfhack can. If you see a cobaltite vein, and dig it with the digv command, then notice that a single tile is left over... thats the hidden fun stuff. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>20. Guilds reset attributes.</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">Since joining a guild or milita<em>ry group transforms the dwarf into a new creature, you can abuse this by transforming him again and again till you find a dwarf with near perfect stats. Might cost some gold though.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><br />
          <strong>Spoiler Material – Read with   care</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Once you dig into hell, you will notice a significant difference to normal DF. You can dig slade. That makes colonizing hell a lot easier, since you can dig a safe bunker directly into the floor. Slade will also leave slade boulders, which you can use for doors and hatches, securing your position.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>A Request:</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">If you know any more exploits, cheats or just neat little tricks you found while playing <em>the mod, please leave me a PM in the forum or post about it. I will add it into this list. :)</em></p></td>
