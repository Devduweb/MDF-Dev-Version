<h1>Plump Helmet Men</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" height="63" width="755" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time,
averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may
attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their
numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate
area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will
rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they
are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They
will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping
creatures.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like
vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the
rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the
creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run
away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once,
so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly
outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going
berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were
not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance
of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate
miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture,
because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky
strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they
will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is
now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their
own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the
ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture
them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the
dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also
prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups
can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of
guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest
method: just eat them!</p>
</div>
<h1 align="left">Succubi</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">The
succubi are human sized creatures will demonic properties. They escaped
the abyss at the beginning and history and enjoyed the freedom the
surface gave them. The love wandering geat palaces where gem windows
meet finely decorated furniture and producing the most exquisite works
of art imaginable, as long as your share their vision of art. But in
the underground lies complex dungeons, where the succubi perform dark rituals.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The race has an heavy gender inbalance or 9 females to
1 male. This leads to your fort getting few children to take care of.
However, you should be careful to protect married couples and their
children as a tragedy can lead to simultaneous tantrums.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Gameplay
wise, the civilization is between dwarves and warlocks. You will be
able to upgrade your fighter with powerful spells, and use creature
specialized in military or civilian uses. Production and management
however is similar to a standard race.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Civilian succubi are lazy
and will take long breaks, but their good intelligence will allow them to
produce fine goods for you. Their short temper, however, will make
raising mood a
priority. If tantrum spirals are less likely,&nbsp;fights can break
out easily. As an alternative to
migrants, they
can turn other races into half breeds using the Den of Iniquity. In
addition to the basic succubi attributes, converted prisoners retain
perks from their former race. Converted prisoners always join your
civilization immediatly.</p>

<h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2><p align="left">The succubi are exceptionnaly good at several skills, learning those at
an increased rate. The learning speed depends of their former race.
Pure sucubi does not have the same advantages than a former dwarf or
human for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure succubi learn sorcery and animal training
quickly.</li>
<li>Cambions (elf) &nbsp;are good ambushers and
archers but not great miners.</li>
<li>Devils (human) &nbsp;are good traders.</li>
<li>Fiends (dwarf) are good mechanics, &nbsp;miners
and melee fighters, they are also immune to antracite dust, but are bad
sorcerers.</li>
<li>Hellions (goblin) are good lashers but bad sorcerers.</li>
<li>Imps (kobold) are great dodgerss, knife users,
swimmers and ambushers but are small and bad animal trainers.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat:&nbsp;</strong>
The succubi have
good strength and great agility, but their endurance is lacking. They
hit quickly in battle, landing crippling blows before their
enemies have the time to react. As a result there is a huge difference
between a badly trained warrior and a legendary fighter. Their poor
focus on
the other hand make them average archers at best. They do not bite,
instead using health draining kisses, injecting a dimming venom.</p>
<h2><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lasher weapons : Whips (blunt) and bladed whips
(edged).</li>
<li>Piercing : Pitchforks, can be upgraded at the soul
forge for more strength and ranged attacks.</li>
<li>Blades : Large daggers, duel swords, long swords and
claymore.</li>
<li>Axes : Double edged axes and great axes.</li>
<li>Ranged : Recurve bows for general support, stygian
pitchforks can fire special shards that can explode or causes syndromes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ammo</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrows</li>
<li>Spell shard : Does less damage than ammo but special
ones can be made at the soul forge.</li>
<ul>
<li>Force shard : causes a cave in effect, knocking
creatures out.</li>
<li>Blight shard : creates severe necrosis clouds</li>
<li>Pain shard : inflict pain to the affect creatures</li>
<li>Make sure you properly set up the ammo in your
military screen. Do not let your warriors train with special shard!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Armor</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Standard gauntlets, boots and helmet.</li>
<li>Corsets for the body. Those does not protect well but
can be worn at the same time as a leather armor or a stolen breastplate.</li>
<li>You can make chain mails from metal or bodysuits from
leather for an additional layer of protection.</li>
<li>Round shields. Setting the uniform on shield/buckler
will let the succubi pick better shields from fallen enemies.</li>
</ul>
You can also improve several armor pieces taken from the invaders at
the soul forge.
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Materials:</strong>&nbsp;The
succubi cannot make steel or mithril, by a lack of focus or
technology. They are unable to clean rusty steel too. You can
get these metals by melting equipment picked from (dead) invaders. In
this case, those will be your best metals to make weapons from.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They have, however,
access to two lightweight
metals: Stygian bronze and basiliskine. Those materials are well
suited to make armor and are still effective for blades. Stygian bronze
is made from regular bronze and flux
stone, basiliskine must be sheared from lesser basilisks and treated at
a smelter. Be careful that those metals, having high value, will make
sieges harder once produced.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have access to
sand and magma, you can build a floating glass furnace and make glass
blocks and windows in great quantities. Making raw glass and pouring it
at the furnace will help you make glass constructions faster.</p>
<h2><strong>Pets</strong></h2><p style="text-align: left;">You
will&nbsp;have a choice of creatures at the embark screen. That
includes the underground creatures plus a few select demonic entities.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nahash</span>:
a vermin hunting snake. Cheap, but not very strong on its own.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rat
thing</span>: a vermin hunting rat. They can teleport towards
their enemies for a surprise attack.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soul
wisp</span>:
Those little balls of light will boost your civilians a bit. When
killed they also release a gas that put surrounding creatures to sleep.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Orthus</span>:
a two headed aggressive dog. They can be trained for hunting or war.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cauchemar</span>:
a strong horse that never tire. The females can be milked. They also
require a small grazing space.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tentacle
monster</span>:
a good fighter. Those can be 'milked' for a slime that can act as a
substitute for oil. They also leave contaminants that will stun
intruders walking in.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lesser
basilisks</span>: reptiles that breath poisonous vapors. Their
horn can be sheared to produce basiliskine, a lightweight steel grade
metal.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shothoth
spawn</span>: a large monster that will turn itself invisible to
its enemies and&nbsp; hit with a deadly necrosis slime.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire imp</span>:
&nbsp;a small humanoid that can hurl fireballs at its enemies.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horrible
Fell Spirit</span>: Unavailable at the embark screen. An HFS can
many things, most of those are very deadly.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">All
those creatures can be summoned in your fort by building a summoning
circle and seeking the items required for their arrival. None of those
creatures affect each other or the succubi with their syndromes (except
the HFS, be careful with those). They
can also eat plants found in evil biomes without going mad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to those
creatures, scouts may go and tame other pets their civilizations have
encountered during world gen.</p><h2><strong>Digging</strong></h2><p align="left">Mining
has not been changed. But some shallow rock types and rubble patches
only leave dust when mined, which forces you to dig deeper for real
rock. Fossils, relics and treasure can be dug up from ruins, your
archeologist can identify and restore them. You can also stumble upon
the Gems of Armok, which have special effects tied to them, like
blessing the miner, or water, magma and metal generation.</p>
<p align="left">Something
to note is that mining warpstone is much safer. In fact, a miner
breathing unstable warpstone will be euphoric for a few seconds. It is
best to leave coal mining to devils (converted dwarves) as your succubi
can suffer from black lungs.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong>&nbsp;Your
embark selection is pretty much the same as in vanilla. You dont
necessarily need an anvil, because you can make them from ore in the
smelter, but otherwise everything is the same. Some more pets, some
more metals, but nothing that stands out.</p>
<h2><strong>Nobles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Queen,
baron, count, duke,</span> the usual nobles. They contribute
little besides issuing mandates ... for now.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader
/ Mistress</span>, the selected leader of your dungeon, they will
conduct meetings with unhappy workers and diplomats.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lady
of Pain</span>, the leader of your military, you might need her
quickly, but
you will be hard pressed to meet her standards. Treat her well and she
will be happy to terminate your enemies in the most painful ways
possible.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle
guides</span> will lead your military squads under
the command of the lady of pain. They will all ask for an assigned tomb
so their names and feats are remembered.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforcer
/ Guardian,</span> the lawgiver of your dungeon. She will manage
you jail as usual.
When 50 succubi have settled inside the walls, the guardian can build a
squad to keep the tiny order a dungeon full of demon can support.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whipper</span>s
handle capital punishment. When she is not whipping criminals, she
will&nbsp; 'deal' with unhappy workers to help her mistress.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeper
of secrets</span>, the manager and book keeper in the same role.
This position is usually given to the most shy succubus who has no
issue
disappearing for months in her office.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attorney</span>,
the assigned
broker and merchant. In truth the one who can afford to speak with
orcs, goblins and drows. She will measure your wealth and will sell
your unwanted items, once she is done drinking, sleeping and partying.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Magic</strong></h2><p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Magic
is learned one skill at a time at the Temple of Sin or Fire. Use the
workshop profile to select who will get the upgrade then run the
associated reaction to give your succubus the new interactions. Remeber
to put the military off duty if you are trying to upgrade a soldier.
Many spells being fire based, it is a good idea to grant fire immunity
to your pyromancer, this is done at the Temple of Fire.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, there is global effects
ran into the Abyssal Temple or the Esoteric Order, timing those
reactions will make a difference between victory or a crushed fort.</p>
<h2><strong>Tech</strong></h2><p align="left">The
more advanced buildings have a multitude of sources. Some require
magma, others blueprints or special items traded using the Attorney's
stock. You can spawn magma using a magma well, operated by a fireborn
succubus, this will enable the construction of magma forges.</p>
<h2><strong>Important stuff</strong></h2><p align="left">You
will be attacked early. Very early! So start preparing defences
immediatly! Otherwise you must be playing with temperature ON. I also
recommend disabling diseases as there is currently&nbsp;no means to
fight those.</p>
<p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF
has&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;invader race,
Goblins. MasterworkDF has&nbsp;<strong>sixteen</strong>.
This means up a lot more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes.
Again, these are optional. You can even add another&nbsp;<strong>fifteen</strong>fortress
defence races to it.</p>
