          <p align="center"><em>Elite
succubi are not only excellent dodgers and strickers, they can also
bring powerful spells to the field. You can use the workshop profile
(shift + P) to select who gets the upgrade. They do not require an
enabled job.</em></p><ul><li>While
Gehenna fire provides good fire attacks, Torrid kiss is a free action
and will burn your enemies without interrupting melee attacks.</li><li>Berserk
rage is more effective if the fighter is miserable but still have
effect if the fighter is happy. It can be combined with Martial
Excitation.</li><li>Learning the secrets of lust provide area of effect
buffs and dimming interactions. At regular intervals, the courtesans
will blink, meaning that their combat abilities are multiplied. </li></ul><p align="center"><em>
            <strong>2. Clearing sieges</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>It
is important to clear sieges before late spring to allow your
civilization's caravan to visit you, otherwise you will not receive
migrants for a year. There is a few rituals that can help you :</em></p><ul><li><em></em>Sow
discord (6 souls) will cause infighting among the
invaders. This is the quickest way to get rid of a squad of enemies.</li><li>Lure invaders (1 soul) will break camps and call all the invaders into your traps.</li><li>Conjure
fire storm (temple of fire, 1 soul) have a decent chance to burn
enemies outside. It is especially good if your fighters are fireborn.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">3. Fire immunity</p><p style="text-align: center;">The
temple of fire provides fire - and cold - immunity. You can use that to
channel magma, work on glaciers, throw burning attacks safely or play
in the
forest fires.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If a succubus can be
fire immune, her clothes will not be. To avoid accidents, military
uniforms made of fire safe materiel can help you. Or you can assign an
empty uniform in 'replace clothing' mode, the succubi are much less
affected by the lack of clothing.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">Do not forget that you can still drown in magma.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">4. Evil biomes</p><p style="text-align: center;">On
the surface of evil biomes, you can pick black roses and bloodworms.
Wine made from those plants will have positive effect on your succubi.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If your civilization has settled on evil biomes, you will also be able to buy those plants from the carvans.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">5. Adventuring as a succubus</p><p style="text-align: center;">There
is plenty of caste choices as an adventurer. Half breed all have their
perks, and fireborn succubi can swim in magma. Use the gender selection
before starting your adventures to switch castes.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If
you look at the civilization's border before starting, you will likely
find forts with succubi soldiers to recruit inside. After completing a few
quest, the local lady will give you more tasks, allowing you to work for your
civilization instead of humans.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p></td>
