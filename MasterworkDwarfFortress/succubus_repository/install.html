        <p>This
mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, thats it. When you are
reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulation. Please do
not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into
a new folder.</p>
        <p>To alter the mod, you can run the
Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Succubus
as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Races' and you will see
a large list of civilizations. Currently Dwarves, Orcs, Kobolds,
Gnomes, Warlocks and Succubi are potentially playable. Tick the box
under 'Fort Mode' and all is done.</p>
        <p>If you just want to
play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable.
It will make embarking easier, since you dont have to chose your race
ingame.</p>

        <p>When you report bugs, please state the mod version and
the tileset you use. If you run the mod on Mac or Linux, please state
this as well. I need this kind of info, otherwise I cant search in the
right places.</p><p>If your bug is related to the civilization itself (problem with workshop, caravans, etc.), please report it to the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=138901.0" target="_blank">race's dedicated thread</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started </strong></p>
        <p>The
succubi are a race of lesser demons who like settling away from the
abyss. They are intelligent, strong, and extremely agile.&nbsp;On the
other hand, hey are not very good archers, they take breaks often and
are quick to anger.</p><p>Their metalurgy is also lacking when it come
to protection. They cannot make steel and their armor does not protect
well. This is why they must rely on dodging and blocking. Something they have little trouble to achieve with enough
training.</p><p>The race has an heavy gender inbalance or 9 females to
1 male. This leads to your fort getting few children to take care of.
However, you should be careful to protect married couples and their
children as a tragedy can lead to simultaneous tantrums.</p><p>Gameplay
wise, the civilization is between dwarves and warlocks. You will be
able to upgrade your fighter with powerful spells, and use creature
specialized in military or civilian uses. Production and management
however is similar to a standard race.</p><p>The game is, as a whole,
easier while playing as the succubi. Several pitfalls can be avoided
and the race's feature are additive, enabling you to learn the feature
at your own pace.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark</u></strong></p>
        <p>The
succubi use a mix of surface and underground features. They enjoy
expansive palace where dark stone and gem windows meet decorated
furniture. &nbsp;Each fort in their kingdom must be treated as a work of art.</p><p>But
the finely decorated bedrooms hide a darker secret. In the underground,
dark temples maintain a link between the surface and the horrors below,
enabling the succubi to summon powerful monsters while the witches
sacrify the souls of their enemies for their own leisure, or their
enemies pain.</p><p>If possible, succubi prefer to embark on evil
biomes. They particulary enjoy drinking wine made from evil plants and
their cattle does not suffer there. Beward of
the undead who will never understand desires the way lust demons do.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark Preparation</u></strong>        </p>
        
        <p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">You
will be able to live with a standard inventory. However you have to
keep in mind that sieges will start very early. So it is a good idea to
prepare one of your original succubi as a trained fighter.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br />Skills</strong>:</p>- Same as dwarves for 6 succubi : 2 miners, a lumberjack, a carpenter, a mason, a farmer<br />- Idealy one combat capable succubus to appoint as lady of pain.<br />- Do not separate organizer and bookkeeper. The keeper of secrets position fill both roles.<br /><p><strong>Items</strong>:</p><p>- Standard items a regular fort uses. What worked for dwarves will for for the succubi.<br />- Your succubi are not alcohol dependant so drinks are not as vital if there is water.<br />- You can buy surface plants at the embark screen.<br />- A weapon and an helmet to equip your lady of pain. Bronze is the best budget metal.</p><p><strong>Pets</strong>:</p><p>- Tentacle monsters are expensive but will provides an oil substitute, sets contaminant traps and are good fighters.<br />- Orthus are similar to dogs but stronger, they can serve as bodyguards.<br />- Nahashes or rat things will hunt vermins around.<br />- You will start with 2 cauchemars. Those can follow in simple fights or provide your with early milk.</p><p> </p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>First things on the map</u></strong>        </p>
        <p>First
appoit your lady of pain and create a squad for her. Get her to
train quickly and give her 2 sparring mates after the first migration
wave. Be careful of her happines however, digging a room for her and making early furniture with your carpenter is a good idea.</p><p>Otherwise the standard procedure to securing your supplies
and making the fort sustainable and defended apply. You must keep in
mind that 'good' guys are on the way so a drawbridge and basic defences are a
priority.</p><p>Afterwards
you can slaughter your starting cauchemars. Turn their skulls into
totems and you will be able to build a summoning circle and start
bringing extra beasts. Their souls can be used at the temple of sin to
offer a couple of extra moves to your warriors.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Advancing</u></strong>        </p>
        <p>Build
a jeweler workshop and start cutting gems. Those will let you conserve
souls at the Soul Well. Large gems also allow you to summon fire imps.</p><p>The
temple of fire can add fire immunity to your warriors, combining that
with fire imps, torrid kiss or other fire interactions will give you an
edge.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also make a worker fire immune and start
digging space for a magma reservoir with a magma well designed to pour
into it. Use your fire immune succubi to summon magma. Buliding your
furnaces on top of those will unlock most of the industry.</p><p>As an
alternative to immigrants, making a large quantity of cage traps will
allow you to turn prisoners into more succubi. Build their cage near a
den of iniquity and, afterwards, free them using a lever. Be careful
that their mount will remain hostile no matter what.</p><p>You can seek
better armor materials, summoned basilisks can be sheared for horns.
Turning their horns into bars in the smelter will yield a metal as
strong as steel but much lighter. Basiliskine is great for armor making.</p><p><br /></p>
