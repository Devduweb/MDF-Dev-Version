        <p>This
mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, thats it. When you are
reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulation. Please do
not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into
a new folder.</p>
        <p>To alter the mod, you can run the
Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Succubus
as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Races' and you will see
a large list of civilizations. Currently Dwarves, Orcs, Kobolds,
Gnomes, Warlocks and Succubi are potentially playable. Tick the box
under 'Fort Mode' and all is done.</p>
        <p>If you just want to
play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable.
It will make embarking easier, since you dont have to chose your race
ingame.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">How to do a bug report</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry,
had to add this. When you report bugs, please state the mod version and
the tileset you use. If you run the mod on Mac or Linux, please state
this as well. I need this kind of info, otherwise I cant search in the
right places.</p>
<hr />
<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started </strong></p>
        <p>BOLTGUN:
Short introduction here please. "Succubi are this and that and do this
and that." No specifics, just to get people interested.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark</u></strong></p>
        <p>The
succubi use a mix of surface and underground features. They enjoy
expansive palace where dark stone and gem windows meet decorated
furniture.&nbsp;</p><p>- Cults underneath</p>- Evil biomes
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark Preparation</u></strong>        </p>
        <p><strong>BOLTGUN: </strong>A
few sentences about what skills are important at embark, what items to
bring (do you need anvils, or special buildmats for example), and what
pets to buy for your standard embark.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills</strong>:</p><p>- One fighter</p><p>- Manager + bookkeeper </p>
        <p><strong>Items</strong>:</p><p>- Anvil</p><p>- Evil plant </p>
        <p><strong>Pets</strong>:</p><p>- none </p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>First things on the map</u></strong>        </p>
        <p>BOLTGUN:
How you start, lets say the first 2 seasons or so. Just tell the people
what they need to build. If everything is like vanilla DF and your
workshops are more late game, just say that.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Advancing</u></strong>        </p>
        <p>BOLTGUN: <strong> A short intro into the more adv. mod features, like your prisoner conversion. Generally just goals the player can aim at.</strong>Again, just very general, to give people an idea.</p>
