<td width="665">The succubi unfortunatly did not develop metallurgy as
well as other races and are outclassed by dwarves. It is a good idea to
sort the spoils from sieges and melt down steel and mithril items you
will find, with perhaps the exception of breastplates that you can wear
on top of corsets.

<p><strong>Stygian Bronze </strong>is made at the smelter using bronze
and flux stone. I addition of yielding even more metal per reaction (2
bars for 1 bronze), stygian bronze in unnaturaly lightweight. This
metal is good for armor, providing protection without hurting speed and
okay for cutting weapons. It is bad for blunt attacks and non bladed
whips.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basiliskine</span> is,
like stygian bronze, a lightweight metal suited for cutting weapons and
armors. It's resistance is at the same level as steel, making it your
best choice of protection without sacrifying mobility. It is obtained
by shearing lesser basilisk (or their larger cousins) to obtain an horn
that can be treated at the smelter.</p>
<p><strong>Warpstone,</strong> usually fatal to
those who mine it, is benefitial to Succubi. Your miners get positive
effects from mining both weak and unstable warpstone.</p>
