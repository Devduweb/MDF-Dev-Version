      <td width="665"><h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Succubi</a></h1>
        <p align="center">The
succubi are human sized creatures will demonic properties. They have
good strength and great agility, but their endurance is lacking. They
hit quickly in battle, landing crippling blows before their
enemies have the time to react. As a result there is a huge difference
between a badly trained warrior and a legendary fighter. Their poor
focus on
the other hand make them average archers at best.</p><p align="center">They
do not bite in battle, instead using life draining kisses and licks.
Those attacks can inject venom that reduces speed or even put someone
to sleep. Another combat asset are their hooves, giving kicks some
extra damage.</p><p align="center">As&nbsp;civilians, the succubi are lazy
and will take long breaks, but their good intelligence will help them
produce fine goods for you. Their short temper, however, will make raising mood a
priority. If tantrum spirals are less likely,&nbsp;fights can break out easily.</p><p align="center">They
can turn other races into half breeds using the Den of Iniquity. In
addition to the basic succubi attributes, converted prisoners retain
perks from their former race.</p><p align="center">It is easier to play
this civilization in general. They are stronger, have fewer children to
take care off and several pitfalls can be avoided. The succubi also
take advantage from evil elements where other races suffer.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="bb" id="bb">Nobles</a></h1>
        <ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Queen, baron, count, duke,</span> the usual nobles. They contribute little besides issuing mandates ... for now.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader / Mistress</span>, the selected leader of your dungeon, they will conduct meetings with unhappy workers and diplomats.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lady
of Pain</span>, the leader of your military, you might need her quickly, but
you will be hard pressed to meet her standards. Treat her well and she
will be happy to terminate your enemies in the most painful ways
possible.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle guides</span> will lead your military squads under
the command of the lady of pain. They will all ask for an assigned tomb
so their names and feats are remembered.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforcer / Guardian,</span> the lawgiver of your dungeon. She will manage you jail as usual.
When 50 succubi have settled inside the walls, the guardian can build a
squad to keep the tiny order a dungeon full of demon can support.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whipper</span>s
handle capital punishment. When she is not whipping criminals, she
will&nbsp; 'deal' with unhappy workers to help her mistress.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeper
of secrets</span>, the manager and book keeper in the same role. This position is usually given to the most shy succubus who has no issue
disappearing for months in her office.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attorney</span>, the assigned
broker and merchant. In truth the one who can afford to speak with orcs, goblins and drows. She will measure your wealth and will sell your unwanted items, once she is done drinking, sleeping and partying.</li></ul>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">Pets</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You
will&nbsp;have a choice of creatures at the embark screen. That
includes the underground creatures plus a few select demonic entities.</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nahash</span>: a vermin hunting snake. Cheap, but not very strong on its own.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rat thing</span>: a vermin hunting rat. They can teleport towards their enemies for a surprise attack.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soul wisp</span>:
Those little balls of light will boost your civilians a bit. When
killed they also release a gas that put surrounding creatures to sleep.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Orthus</span>: a two headed aggressive dog. They can be trained for hunting or war.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cauchemar</span>: a strong horse that never tire. The females can be milked. They also require a small grazing space.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tentacle monster</span>:
a good fighter. Those can be 'milked' for a slime that can act as a
substitute for oil. They also leave contaminants that will stun intruders walking in.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lesser basilisks</span>: reptiles that breath poisonous vapors. Their horn can be sheared to produce basiliskine, a lightweight steel grade metal.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shothoth spawn</span>: a large monster that will turn itself invisible to its enemies and&nbsp; hit with a deadly necrosis slime.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire imp</span>: &nbsp;a small humanoid that can hurl fireballs at its enemies.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horrible Fell Spirit</span>: Unavailable at the embark screen. An HFS can many things, most of those are very deadly.</li></ul><p align="center">All
those creatures can be summoned in your fort by building a summoning
circle and seeking the items required for their arrival. None of those
creatures affect each other or the succubi with their syndromes (except the HFS, be careful with those). They
can also eat plants found in evil biomes without going mad.</p><p align="center">In addition to those creatures, scouts may go and tame other pets their civilizations have encountered during world gen.<br /></p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc2" id="cc2">Items</a></h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">You
have access to most of the standard items of the game. Surface and
underground crops will also be both available for trading. Here is the
weapons and protection you can produce for your military:</p><p style="text-align: left;">Armors :</p><ul><li>Standard gauntlets, boots and helmet.</li><li>Corsets for the body. Those does not protect well but can be worn at the same time as a leather armor or a stolen breastplate.</li><li>You can make chain mails from metal or bodysuits from leather for an additional layer of protection.</li><li>Round shields. Setting the uniform on shield/buckler will let the succubi pick better shields from fallen enemies.</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;">Weapons :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Lasher weapons : Whips (blunt) and bladed whips (edged).</li><li>Piercing : Pitchforks, can be upgraded at the soul forge for more strength and ranged attacks.</li><li>Blades : Large daggers, duel swords, long swords and claymore.</li><li>Axes : Double edged axes and great axes.</li><li>Ranged : Recurve bows for general support, stygian pitchforks can fire special shards that can explode or causes syndromes.</li></ul>Traps :<br /><ul><li>Sawblades, several workshops require those.</li><li>Axe blades, spiked balls, razor wires and serrated spikes.</li><li>Pump mechanisms are used to move fluids.</li></ul>Ammo : <br /><ul><li>Arrows</li><li>Spell shard : Does less damage than ammo but special ones can be made at the soul forge.</li><ul><li>Force shard : causes a cave in effect, knocking creatures out.</li><li>Blight shard : creates severe necrosis clouds</li><li>Pain shard : inflict pain to the affect creatures</li><li>Make sure you properly set up the ammo in your military screen. Do not let your warriors train with special shard!</li></ul></ul>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="mini" id="dd3">Materials</a></h1>
        <p align="center">The
succubi cannot make steel or mithril, by a lack of focus or
technology. They are unable to clean rusty steel too. You can
get these metals by melting equipment picked from (dead) invaders. In
this case, those will be your best metals to make weapons from.</p><p align="center">They have, however, access to two lightweight
metals: Stygian bronze and basiliskine. Those materials are well
suited to make armor and are still effective for blades. Stygian bronze is made from regular bronze and flux
stone, basiliskine must be sheared from lesser basilisks and treated at
a smelter. Be careful that those metals, having high value, will make
sieges harder once produced.</p><p align="center">If you have access to
sand and magma, you can build a floating glass furnace and make glass
blocks and windows in great quantities. Making raw glass and pouring it
at the furnace will help you make glass constructions faster.</p><p align="center">Something
to note is that mining warpstone is much safer. In fact, a miner
breathing unstable warpstone will be euphoric for a few seconds. It is
best to leave coal mining to devils (converted dwarves) as your succubi
suffer from black lungs.<br /></p>
<hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Special Tactics</a></h1>
      <p align="center">This
civilization does not move away from the core Dwarf Fortress gameplay. However you will be pressured into
pushing your defenses further and new workshops will help you
prepare your fort. Hopefully, you can build all kinds of explosive or magic effects.</p><p align="center">Managing souls will be important. Those can be
obtained by butchering or using a soul well near your
refuse stockpile. Cut gems or glass can prevent the souls from withering.</p><p align="center">Summoned
pets will help you defend your dungeon. Nightmares are a first defense
against intruders, fire imps can be used as fireball turrets and
tentacle monsters will lay contaminants that will stop unprotected
creatures. Do not hesitate to try out what every pet has to offer. The
succubi raises the animal training skill faster than other races so
having a few dedicated trainers will prevent a loss of control.</p><p align="center">You
can give new interactions to your warriors at the temples of sin and
fire. It will be up to you to decide how you will combine those
upgrades. Under the right conditions, an upgraded succubus can take on
many intruders at once.&nbsp;</p><p align="center">You do not have to
rely on migrants to increase your numbers. Luring invaders to your cage
traps will allow you to turn them into members of your civilization.</p><p align="center">Using
the abyssal temple reactions&nbsp;against invaders will give you an
edge in battle, slamming enemies in the middle of a combat or turning
them against each other.</p><p align="center">There is some civilian
effects to use too. Soul wisps will increases your workers skills a bit
and several reactions will help managing the mood of your dungeon.</p></td>
