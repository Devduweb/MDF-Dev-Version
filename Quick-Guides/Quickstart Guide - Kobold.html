      </p>
<p align="center">Just a few words to get you started.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>General info:</strong> Kobolds are numerous, tantrum resistant, weak and stupid. Your camp will be on the surface and in the soil layers, protected mostly by wartrained pets and ranged-bolds. Farming animals for leather, bone and meat is most important, farming plants for dye, juice, tea and tobacco not so much. Main income source of better items is stealing, which is risky but the only way to advance further.</p>
      <p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Kobolds have natural skills in herbalism, blowgun, dodging, poisoning and sneaking. The most important skills in camp life is leatherworking.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Kobolds are tiny and weak, and should rely on ranged weapons and traps. Melee combat is mostly done by your pet-ogres.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> Most weapons are too big for kobolds, so you have make your own, weak ones. Slings, Blowguns and Bola-Throwers are the weapons of choice.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> You have cheap poisoned ammo at the start, use it. Slowpoke blowdarts.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Kobold armor is slightly inferior to those of other races. Shin/Thight/Wrist-Guards, Plated Hides and Caps.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> The main building material is leather, you need wood for fuel, different sorts of leather for armor. Fire-safe blocks should be made from bone. Clay is unlimited, but needs fuel.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Kobolds use shalswars to hunt vermin, trap spiders for silk-farms, ogres to fight, fisher-gremlins to fish, badgers and keas as sacred animals that can be interacted with, and psychoactive toads that give truly random effects. Jack rats are the main food source, giving birth to 3-5 babies.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Kobolds need meat. They wont eat plants, so farm-plots are only for extra-ingredients, main food source is animal farming, fishing and hunting.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol makes kobolds dizzy. Press juices or brew tea instead.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Kobolds can only dig soil, gems and ores. No rock, no coal.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> You should take many, many jack-rats with you, for meat, leather and bones. Embark on a cave to have access to the caverns, which is really important for you. Fisher-Gremlins can take some workload at the start and supply you with fishes.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> The nobles are exactly the same as in dwarf mode, just with different names.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>You have 2 mages, ranged and melee, but both take a while to create. Dont worry about it now.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> You high-tech workshops are stolen from other civs. You will lose kobolds this way. You will also trigger sieges this way. But its the only way to get these building plans.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Kobolds come in twelve types. Simple changes, so dont worry about it. Viper, Badger and Lizard are good for combat though.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Cave-Embarks, plants for dyes, poisons, leather, leather, leather, Ogres.</p>

      <p align="center">Thats it. If you want more information have a look at the bigger manual.
      <p align="center">Have !FUN!,
      <p align="center">Meph</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>PS:</strong> Known exploit: Steal from civs that dont exist at worldgen, they cant siege you. Or cavern civs, they might siege but have no path from the caverns to the surface. That should enable you to get more building plans with a smaller risk then usually.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>PPS:</strong> Most features are rather untested/unbalanced, so if anything seems odd to you or doesnt work like described in the manual, feel free to go to the forum and post about it. It really helps me refine the mod.</p></td>
